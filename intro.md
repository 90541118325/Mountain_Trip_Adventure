The day was clear, and so, we started very early in the morning at the feet of a very attractive mountain series. The weather was fine with a clear sky and fresh cool air blowing through the branches of green trees. After some time, I realized that we were all happy to be outside moving around in nature and not cars, people, and noise among other things. 
 
 Inhaling sharply, there was silence so I settled back in the excitement of our mission. Atop the mountains were giants of beautiful features which could only be enclosed by climbing them. We got into more discussions as we prepared to go for the hike. 
 
 Ahead of us were two trails:
 
 - To the left, there was a narrowly defined, overgrown path, which led into the woods. We were told that if we went there we would find a waterfall and there would be a good view.
 - To the right there was a difference- the trail was steeper and narrower and the ground was all big rocks. It would be more difficult, but in the middle, at the top, we can see the whole area, itâ€™ll be great. 
 
 Now, we just had to decide which path to take.
