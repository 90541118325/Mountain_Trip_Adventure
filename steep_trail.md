The Steeper Mountain Trail 
 And so, we decide to go for the steep slopes of the mountain. It is a very tough journey though the more one ascends, the more beautiful the view gets. When we get to higher levels of the Cloud Structure the ground below is more clearly and in color. The terrain becomes a little rough and there is likelihood of slipping hence we have to be more careful on our next moves. Then, after a while, we get to this point in the jungle that there joins several trails again. 
 
 Do you: 
 
 Carry on up to the top if you want the best vantage point. 
 Stay at this neighbouring formation made of rocks before making the final decision.
