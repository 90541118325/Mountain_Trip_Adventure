We have to drive up for quite a while and, having seen what the mountain looks like, we decide to take a breather and spend night at the campsite before the massive trekking. In the process, we can prepare a light meal and get to sit by the camp fire as well as sit back and enjoy the serene environment. 
 
The trees also become a beautiful orange as the sun sets and all is quite dark before the lights of the city come on and the night is really dark. 
 
 Do you: 
 
 1. Sleep early and wake up early for the hike tomorrow. 
 2. Go for a walk in the woods at night time
