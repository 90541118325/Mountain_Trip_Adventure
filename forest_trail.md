The Scenic Forest Path 
 
 Since the forest trail looked less boring we decided to take it. There is a carpet of leaves and moss hence the path is soft coupled with chilly weather with occasional sunlight with thick leaves overhead. Approximately 30 minutes into the hike we hear the sound of running water. 
 
 If one pursues this sound, he/she comes across a beautiful waterfall cascading over large rocks. The water is absolutely clear while looking around and you donâ€™t see any other people around. We step aside to chew some packets of biscuits and take a rest because the view is so beautiful and the weather very conducive. 
 
 
 The last thing is to keep the staff engaged through the provision of incentives for increased performance.
